This project presents a design and prototype implementation of a new home automation🏠 system that uses WiFi technology as a network infrastructure connecting its parts. The proposed system consists of two main components; the first part is the server (webserver)🌐, which presents the system core that manages, controls, and monitors🖥️ the user's🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 home🏠. Users🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 and the system administrators👨‍💻 can locally (LAN)🖥️🖥️ or remotely (internet)🌐 manage and control system code📄. The second part is the hardware interface module, which provides an appropriate interface to sensors and actuators⚙️ of the home automation🏠 system. Unlike most available home automation🏠 systems in the market, the proposed system is scalable that one server🌐 can manage many hardware interface modules as long as it exists on WiFi network coverage. The system supports a wide range of home automation🏠 devices like power🔋 management components and security🔐 components. The proposed system is better from the scalability and flexibility point of view than the commercially available home automation🏠 systems.

IoT plays an important role in the healthcare⚕️ industry. Pulse💗 rate monitoring for a patient🤒 has to be done every now and then in order to observe their physical health⚕️ condition. A prototype of the system is created. In this project, we are interfacing a pulse💗 rate sensor and temperature🌡️ sensor to Arduino and the data📄 are observed in ThingSpeak cloud☁️ through ESP8266. The data📄 is passed to the cloud☁️ so that it can be accessed from anywhere.

This project is designed to build an obstacle🧱 avoidance robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 using ultrasonic🔊 sensor for its movement. A micro-controller (ATMega 328 P) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot🤖 is a machine that can perform a task automatically or with guidance. Robotics🤖 has a control system, which is a combination of computational intelligence👨‍💻, and Mechanical Build (motors)⚙️. Computational intelligence👨‍💻 involves the programmed instructions📄. The project proposes a robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 that has a control system built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle🧱 comes in its path🛣️. This robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 is built, using a micro-controller of the ATMega family. An ultrasonic🔊 sensor is used to detect any obstacle🧱 ahead of it and sends➡️ a command to the microcontroller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot🤖 to move in the left🤛 direction by actuating the motors⚙️, which are interfaced to it through a motor⚙️ driver.

Ever-increasing greenhouse gases🌋 in the atmosphere🌎 are one of the most dominant factors for long‐term changes in the tropospheric🌎 temperature🌡️ variations📊. To study📖 this fact in the wake of changing global🌎 climatic❄️ scenario, linear 📈 in surface temperature🌡️ and the tropospheric🌎 were examined for the period Jan – Dec in 2017 across Six cities🏙️ in India🇮🇳 (Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata). The mean monthly temperature🌡️ data📄 for well‐spread 6 cities🏙️ across India🇮🇳 were used to examine the significance between temperatures🌡️ all around the months and between cities🏙️ using Two Way Anova Method with the help of R - Language🇷.

Environmental🌳 protection and energy⚡ conservations are the main concern of the 21st century💯, which has now accelerated the pace to plan and develop electric vehicle⚡🚗 technology. The electric vehicles⚡🚗 (EVs) offer a zero-emission, new automobile🚗 industry🏭 establishment, and economic💵 development, efficient and smart transportation🚗🚌🛺 system. 

This project has a hand🖐🏽 gesture🙆‍♂️ controlled🕹️ steering🚘 system to control🕹️ the vehicle🚗 easily. It is designed to be suitable for any road🛣️ conditions and to reduce the effort of a rider🚴‍♂️ to drive skateboard🛹 easily. Currently, the high torque direct current⚡ motors⚙️ are the choice of automobile🚗 industries🏭 and researchers because of its high power⚡ density, compact size, reliability, and noise-free🔉 and minimum maintenance requirements. The fabrication of the vehicle🚗 includes the assembly of skateboard🛹 and electric⚡ hub motor⚙️ drive and designing the gesture🙆‍♂️ controller🕹️.

### _Data Mining📄⛏️ of Weather❄️ and Result📄 Storage💾 in a Web Server🌐 using NodeMCU_

The ideology💡 behind this project is to identify🔍 the weather❄️ conditions at any point on the earth🌎, which can be identified🔍 by its place-name or by its Postcode/ Zipcode/ Pin code🏙️ and make the information📄 logged in a web server🌐. The technologies which we are implementing in this project are Data Mining📄⛏️ and Internet🌐 of Things (IoT), the earlier is the concept of digging⛏️ the data📄 from the vast source of internet🌐 through simple concepts and the IoT🌐 is the best solution to connect🤝 the electronic things to the internet🌐 so that they can be utilized anywhere in the world🌎. 

Our system first collects the weather❄️ details📄 of the place🏙️ entered by the user through openweathermap.org (openweathermap.org is a provider for weather❄️ details) and those details were stored in a webserver🌐/ webpage created. The weather❄️ details📄 shown will be of Temperature🌡️ in the area🏙️, data mining📄⛏️ the server🌐 free API type of weather❄️ is it rainy🌧️, sunny☀️, or stormy🌩️, etc. The data📄 we got will be kept on updating in our web server🌐 and can be accessed from the internet🌐 anytime. We are using NodeMCU for both data mining📄⛏️ and web server🌐 creation in this project.

### _Identification🔍 of Water🌊 Quality inside a Bottle Instantaneously_

In developing countries like India, unsafe drinking water is one of the main problems, many people in rural areas were getting affected by some serious diseases due to this unhygienic usage of water. To control the problems arising from this issue we are planning to develop a water bottle that will detect the impurities in the water-filled in it and to warn the people who were drinking that water.

A sample of water filled in the bottle is collected at the bottom of the bottle and some water quality tests were processed over that sample to identify whether it is good for drinking or not.

The water collected as the sample will be identified for the TDS (total dissolved salts), pH, Turbidity values of the sample water, if they were crossing the warning limits, then a danger indication is given regarding the purity of water.

Accidents are very common anywhere and at any time. Road safety is emerging as a major social concern around the world, especially in India. Alcoholic Driver creating accidents are one of the most significant public problems. There can be various reasons for accidents but the role of alcohol in traffic safety has produced more controversies than any other topic. The major cause of accidents is due to a bad driver, Condition of the road or Condition of the vehicle.

A person who is driving a four-wheeler must wear a seat belt but most of us will ignore this rule. Ignorance of the seatbelt may cause severe loss. In this project, we are developing an auto-lock system to prevent accidents due to two causes,

1. When a drunken person is about to start the engine, It won't allow him to continue driving.

2. If the driver is not wearing a seatbelt, the system will prevent the Ignition to start. 

The input for this is from sensors. The controller works based on sensor inputs if there is any trace of alcohol or ignorance of seat belt the engine will be automatically locked.
