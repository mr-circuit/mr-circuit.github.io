# _"Making Product is better than making a Project"_ 

## Nothing makes me more joyful than just working with some development technology. Electronics is my passion! These are some of the projects I've worked on that you may find interesting.

## Academic Projects

### Data Mining of Weather and Result Storage in a Web Server using NodeMCU

### Identification of Water Quality inside a Bottle Instantaneously

In developing countries like India, unsafe drinking water is one of the main problems, many people in rural areas were getting affected by some serious diseases due to this unhygienic usage of water. To control the problems arising from this issue we are planning to develop a water bottle that will detect the impurities in the water-filled in it and to warn the people who were drinking that water.

A sample of water filled in the bottle is collected at the bottom of the bottle and some water quality tests were processed over that sample to identify whether it is good for drinking or not.

The water collected as the sample will be identified for the TDS (total dissolved salts), pH, Turbidity values of the sample water, if they were crossing the warning limits, then a danger indication is given regarding the purity of water.

### A Smart Ignition system to check Alcoholic Drivers and Seatbelt Overlookers

Accidents are very common anywhere and at any time. Road safety is emerging as a major social concern around the world, especially in India. Alcoholic Driver creating accidents are one of the most significant public problems. There can be various reasons for accidents but the role of alcohol in traffic safety has produced more controversies than any other topic. The major cause of accidents is due to a bad driver, Condition of the road or Condition of the vehicle.

A person who is driving a four-wheeler must wear a seat belt but most of us will ignore this rule. Ignorance of the seatbelt may cause severe loss. In this project, we are developing an auto-lock system to prevent accidents due to two causes,

1. When a drunken person is about to start the engine, It won't allow him to continue driving.

2. If the driver is not wearing a seatbelt, the system will prevent the Ignition to start. 

The input for this is from sensors. The controller works based on sensor inputs if there is any trace of alcohol or ignorance of seat belt the engine will be automatically locked.
