* Masters' Curriculum Project👨🏻‍🎓👨🏻‍🎓
* Credits: Jayasurya Obbu👨🏻‍🎓, Gundu Sushrutha👩🏻‍🎓

This project presents a design and prototype implementation of a new home automation🏠 system that uses WiFi technology as a network infrastructure connecting its parts. The proposed system consists of two main components; the first part is the server (webserver)🌐, which presents the system core that manages, controls, and monitors🖥️ the user's🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 home🏠. Users🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 and the system administrators👨‍💻 can locally (LAN)🖥️🖥️ or remotely (internet)🌐 manage and control system code📄. The second part is the hardware interface module, which provides an appropriate interface to sensors and actuators⚙️ of the home automation🏠 system. Unlike most available home automation🏠 systems in the market, the proposed system is scalable that one server🌐 can manage many hardware interface modules as long as it exists on WiFi network coverage. The system supports a wide range of home automation🏠 devices like power🔋 management components and security🔐 components. The proposed system is better from the scalability and flexibility point of view than the commercially available home automation🏠 systems.

IoT plays an important role in the healthcare⚕️ industry. Pulse💗 rate monitoring for a patient🤒 has to be done every now and then in order to observe their physical health⚕️ condition. A prototype of the system is created. In this project, we are interfacing a pulse💗 rate sensor and temperature🌡️ sensor to Arduino and the data📄 are observed in ThingSpeak cloud☁️ through ESP8266. The data📄 is passed to the cloud☁️ so that it can be accessed from anywhere.

This project is designed to build an obstacle🧱 avoidance robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 using ultrasonic🔊 sensor for its movement. A micro-controller (ATMega 328 P) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot🤖 is a machine that can perform a task automatically or with guidance. Robotics🤖 has a control system, which is a combination of computational intelligence👨‍💻, and Mechanical Build (motors)⚙️. Computational intelligence👨‍💻 involves the programmed instructions📄. The project proposes a robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 that has a control system built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle🧱 comes in its path🛣️. This robotic🤖 vehicle🚗 is built, using a micro-controller of the ATMega family. An ultrasonic🔊 sensor is used to detect any obstacle🧱 ahead of it and sends➡️ a command to the microcontroller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot🤖 to move in the left🤛 direction by actuating the motors⚙️, which are interfaced to it through a motor⚙️ driver.

Ever-increasing greenhouse gases🌋 in the atmosphere🌎 are one of the most dominant factors for long‐term changes in the tropospheric🌎 temperature🌡️ variations📊. To study📖 this fact in the wake of changing global🌎 climatic❄️ scenario, linear 📈 in surface temperature🌡️ and the tropospheric🌎 were examined for the period Jan – Dec in 2017 across Six cities🏙️ in India🇮🇳 (Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata). The mean monthly temperature🌡️ data📄 for well‐spread 6 cities🏙️ across India🇮🇳 were used to examine the significance between temperatures🌡️ all around the months and between cities🏙️ using Two Way Anova Method with the help of R - Language🇷.

Environmental🌳 protection and energy⚡ conservations are the main concern of the 21st century💯, which has now accelerated the pace to plan and develop electric vehicle⚡🚗 technology. The electric vehicles⚡🚗 (EVs) offer a zero-emission, new automobile🚗 industry🏭 establishment, and economic💵 development, efficient and smart transportation🚗🚌🛺 system. 

This project has a hand🖐🏽 gesture🙆‍♂️ controlled🕹️ steering🚘 system to control🕹️ the vehicle🚗 easily. It is designed to be suitable for any road🛣️ conditions and to reduce the effort of a rider🚴‍♂️ to drive skateboard🛹 easily. Currently, the high torque direct current⚡ motors⚙️ are the choice of automobile🚗 industries🏭 and researchers because of its high power⚡ density, compact size, reliability, and noise-free🔉 and minimum maintenance requirements. The fabrication of the vehicle🚗 includes the assembly of skateboard🛹 and electric⚡ hub motor⚙️ drive and designing the gesture🙆‍♂️ controller🕹️.

### _Data Mining📄⛏️ of Weather❄️ and Result📄 Storage💾 in a Web Server🌐 using NodeMCU_

* Masters' Curriculum Project👨🏻‍🎓👨🏻‍🎓
* Credits: Jayasurya Obbu👨🏻‍🎓, Gundu Sushrutha👩🏻‍🎓, Varline Betty Cruze👩🏻‍🎓

The ideology💡 behind this project is to identify🔍 the weather❄️ conditions at any point on the earth🌎, which can be identified🔍 by its place-name or by its Postcode/ Zipcode/ Pin code🏙️ and make the information📄 logged in a web server🌐. The technologies which we are implementing in this project are Data Mining📄⛏️ and Internet🌐 of Things (IoT), the earlier is the concept of digging⛏️ the data📄 from the vast source of internet🌐 through simple concepts and the IoT🌐 is the best solution to connect🤝 the electronic things to the internet🌐 so that they can be utilized anywhere in the world🌎. 

Our system first collects the weather❄️ details📄 of the place🏙️ entered by the user through openweathermap.org (openweathermap.org is a provider for weather❄️ details) and those details were stored in a webserver🌐/ webpage created. The weather❄️ details📄 shown will be of Temperature🌡️ in the area🏙️, data mining📄⛏️ the server🌐 free API type of weather❄️ is it rainy🌧️, sunny☀️, or stormy🌩️, etc. The data📄 we got will be kept on updating in our web server🌐 and can be accessed from the internet🌐 anytime. We are using NodeMCU for both data mining📄⛏️ and web server🌐 creation in this project.

### _Identification🔍 of Water🌊 Quality inside a Bottle🍼 Instantaneously_

In developing countries like India🇮🇳, unsafe drinking water🚱 is one of the main problems, many people🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 in rural areas🏝️ were getting affected by some serious diseases😷 due to this unhygienic usage of water🚱. To control the problems arising from this issue we are planning📜 to develop a water bottle🍼 that will detect the impurities🦠 in the water-filled🌊 in it and to warn the people who were drinking that water🌊.

A sample🧫 of water🌊 filled in the bottle🍼 is collected at the bottom of the bottle🍼 and some water quality🌊 tests🔬 were processed over that sample🧫 to identify🔍 whether it is good🚰 for drinking or not🚱.

The water🌊 collected as the sample🧫 will be identified🔍 for the TDS (total dissolved salts🧂), pH, Turbidity values📄 of the sample🧫 water🌊, if they were crossing the warning⚠️ limits, then a danger indication☠️ is given regarding the purity of water🌊.

Accidents are very common anywhere🌎 and at any time⌚. Road🛣️ safety⚠️ is emerging as a major social concern around the world🌎, especially in India🇮🇳. Alcoholic🍺 Driver🚘 creating accidents are one of the most significant public🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 problems. There can be various reasons for accidents but the role of alcohol🍺 in traffic🚦 safety⚠️ has produced more controversies than any other topic. The major cause of accidents is due to a bad👎 driver🚘, Condition of the road🛣️ or Condition of the vehicle🚗.

A person🧍 who is driving🚘 a four-wheeler🚗 must wear a seatbelt💺 but most of us will ignore this rule📑. Ignorance of the seatbelt💺 may cause severe loss. In this project, we are developing an auto-lock🔐 system to prevent accidents due to these two causes🍺🚘💺,

1. When a drunken🍺 person🧍 is about to start🏁 the engine🔋, It won't allow him to continue driving🚘.

2. If the driver🚘 is not wearing a seatbelt💺, the system will prevent the Ignition🔋 to start🏁. 

The input🔢 for this is from sensors. The controller works based on sensor inputs🔢 if there is any trace of alcohol🍺 or ignorance of seatbelt💺 the engine🔋 will be automatically locked🔒.
