# _**"Making Product is better than making a Project"**_ 

## Nothing makes me more joyful than just working with some development technology. Electronics is my passion! These are some of the projects I've worked on that you may find interesting.

## **Academic Projects**

### _Sonar System Based Obstacle Avoiding Robot_

This project is designed to build an obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle using ultrasonic sensor for its movement. A micro-controller (ATMega 328 P) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot is a machine that can perform a task automatically or with guidance. Robotics has a control system, which is a combination of computational intelligence, and Mechanical Build (motors). Computational intelligence involves the programmed instructions. The project proposes a robotic vehicle that has a control system built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. This robotic vehicle is built, using a micro-controller of the ATMega family. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the microcontroller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in the left direction by actuating the motors, which are interfaced to it through a motor driver.

### _Recent trends in temperature over Six Cities in India during 2017_

Ever-increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are one of the most dominant factors for long‐term changes in the tropospheric temperature variations. To study this fact in the wake of changing global climatic scenario, linear trends in surface temperature and the tropospheric were examined for the period Jan – Dec in 2017 across Six cities in India (Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata). The mean monthly temperature data for well‐spread 6 cities across India were used to examine the significance between temperatures all around the months and between cities using Two Way Anova Method with the help of R - Language.

### _Electronic Skateboard with Hand Gesture Speed Control_

Environmental protection and energy conservations are the main concern of the 21st century, which has now accelerated the pace to plan and develop electric vehicle technology. The electric vehicles (EVs) offer a zero-emission, new automobile industry establishment, and economic development, efficient and smart transportation system. 

This project has a hand gesture controlled steering system to control the vehicle easily. It is designed to be suitable for any road conditions and to reduce the effort of a rider to drive skateboard easily. Currently, the high torque direct current motors are the choice of automobile industries and researchers because of its high power density, compact size, reliability, and noise-free and minimum maintenance requirements. The fabrication of the vehicle includes the assembly of skateboard and electric hub motor drive and designing the gesture controller.

### _Data Mining of Weather and Result Storage in a Web Server using NodeMCU_

The ideology behind this project is to identify the weather conditions at any point on the earth, which can be identified by its place-name or by its Postcode/ Zipcode/ Pin code and make the information logged in a web server. The technologies which we are implementing in this project are Data Mining and Internet of Things (loT), the earlier is the concept of digging the data from the vast source of internet through simple concepts and the loT is the best solution to connect the electronic things to the internet so that they can be utilized anywhere in the world. 

Our system first collects the weather details of the place entered by the user through openweathermap.org (openweathermap.org is a provider for weather details) and those details were stored in a webserver/ webpage created. The weather details shown will be of Temperature in the area, data mining the server free API type of weather is it rainy, sunny, or stormy, etc. The data we got will be kept on updating in our web server and can be accessed from the internet anytime. We are using NodeMCU for both data mining and web server creation in this project.

### _Identification of Water Quality inside a Bottle Instantaneously_

In developing countries like India, unsafe drinking water is one of the main problems, many people in rural areas were getting affected by some serious diseases due to this unhygienic usage of water. To control the problems arising from this issue we are planning to develop a water bottle that will detect the impurities in the water-filled in it and to warn the people who were drinking that water.

A sample of water filled in the bottle is collected at the bottom of the bottle and some water quality tests were processed over that sample to identify whether it is good for drinking or not.

The water collected as the sample will be identified for the TDS (total dissolved salts), pH, Turbidity values of the sample water, if they were crossing the warning limits, then a danger indication is given regarding the purity of water.

### _A Smart Ignition system to check Alcoholic Drivers and Seatbelt Overlookers_

Accidents are very common anywhere and at any time. Road safety is emerging as a major social concern around the world, especially in India. Alcoholic Driver creating accidents are one of the most significant public problems. There can be various reasons for accidents but the role of alcohol in traffic safety has produced more controversies than any other topic. The major cause of accidents is due to a bad driver, Condition of the road or Condition of the vehicle.

A person who is driving a four-wheeler must wear a seat belt but most of us will ignore this rule. Ignorance of the seatbelt may cause severe loss. In this project, we are developing an auto-lock system to prevent accidents due to two causes,

1. When a drunken person is about to start the engine, It won't allow him to continue driving.

2. If the driver is not wearing a seatbelt, the system will prevent the Ignition to start. 

The input for this is from sensors. The controller works based on sensor inputs if there is any trace of alcohol or ignorance of seat belt the engine will be automatically locked.
