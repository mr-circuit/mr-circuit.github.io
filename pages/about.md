# I am an Electronic Geek 

## I depict myself as a Full-Time Electronics Developer and a Part-Time Software Developer

I’m a 22-year-old Electronics Engineer and an Entrepreneur hail from Gudur, Andhra Pradesh, India. I adore doing R&D in Electronics and tuning in to music.

I began my Startup Company in 2016 called Immortal Electronics, the purpose of IE is to help the students and electronic hobbyists to get the Electronics easier by any mean.

I will get more amped up for Electronic Scrap, Damaged Electronic goods,and so on, because they help me to understand more about electronics. In my working hours, you'll see me developing some electronics stuff, and in my leisure time, again you'll see me developing some electronics stuff. As fuel is needed for a vehicle to move, I need Music to move, whenever I'm working you'll find me listening to music.

I will develop Electronics stuff by using different platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Node MCU, ARM, PIC, 8051, Keil uVision, MatLab, LabView, Proteus, OrCAD, Fritzing etc. I use different platforms to code'em like C, C++, C#, Python, Embedded C, HTML, R Language, Shell and so forth.

My greatest quality is, I never say no to any objective that comes to me, regardless of whether it is a Rocket Science I will attempt to learn it and complete the objective.

I adore three individuals the most in this world, they are my Parents and SuperStar Rajinikanth.

This blog is an Insider of my life. I blog to document my ideas, research and personal feelings for future reference.
